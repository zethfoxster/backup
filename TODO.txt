///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

- (100%) x86 and x64 Packets and Crypt Finished by GiGatR00n

- Need to making parsers for Items and Skills

- Need to check datapack (since patch 4.7.5 some parts got changed)

- Need to rewrite GeoDataBuilderJ tool for compiling meshes.geo (new maps don't have collision detection vetores)

- Need to check core side for Aethertech skill (Backlash I - ID:3742) for activate

- Need to check why Assasin class are setting runes at level 1 (Must be checked at core side)

- Need to check the server start. Some troubles with the memory. Just can be seing with more players.

- Supplements  are not working.

- When you disconnect and are grouped, at the last second you can see the other player disconnected.

- Sometimes, a dead mob stay standing.

- Sometimes the fly time generation animation is bugging (but not the actual value).

- In case of full inventory, you can get a quest item (even if you have enough space in your quest inventory).

- When you identify an object, there is no animation (but the identification is working).

- Some geodata bugs (without giving the whole list).

- When you learn a new skill, the notification doesn't appear all the times.

- No game music after the first quest "Prologue", because it's stopped by the movie, and it's not playing after

- Manastone remover price (I guess we have to guess the algorithm, all the public code I found so far have hardcoded values)

- When you have skill cooldowns and you logout and then login, the animation of the remaining time is bugging (keep turning around instead of doing it slowly)

- Some campaing quest icons dont show up in the map. Even on the npcs when you are near them.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

- Need to implement the pangea siege. something there is other cuz the normal siege packet dont change
the state of these fortresses (95% Done by GiGatR00n - left some testing)

- Need to check this instances (Ahserionâ€™s Flight, Shugo Emperor's Vault)

- Need to check 4.5 + instances (IronWall Warfront, Engulfed Ophidan Bridge)

- Need to Add Drops for Beritra Invasion Raid (100% Done by GiGatR00n)

- Need to check all core side for some inconsistent data

- Need to recheck all the instances and their AIs

- Need to check all the Instances Scrolls Reset

(All the instances files need to be checked.)

- Stamp need to be check.

- Arcade Token system need to be check.

- Kaldor base flags (When you port to Kaldor you just see 2 flags instead of 4. Seems that can only show 1 flag per base)

- In Ishalgen, the quest "Where's Rae this time". In the step "Talk with Ulgorn", you have to locate the NPC cause his yellow mark doesn't show up.

- Some mobs (at Altgard, but maybe elsewhere) give double kinahs. I guess it just need to remove one of the kinah reward in the reward list of a given NPC; besides I think it exists a drop parser.

- Quest "Scout it Out" (id 2014): the dialog shows a fail error.

- In Morheim, the quest "Morheim Commander's Call": after the validation of the first step, the description of the second step doesn't show up.

- Quest "Destroying the curse": a pet among 5 is designed to be follow in a cave, but he's not (pet selected: "Baba ring").
